What is next for Howie is "How We See The City!". The plan is to grow this business past the golf cart phase to "short bus" & then mentor other guides with his craft to create a fleet of short busses or maybe even amphibious vessels (like what he was trained on & when he started). Either way, "How We See the City!" is a growing living being & if you are reading this, you (like Howie & all the players mentioned in this story) are a part of that "growing living being", & you are essential to its existence.</div>
